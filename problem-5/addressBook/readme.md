# addressbook
addressbook is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).
addressbook allows the user to perform CRUD operations in the context of contacts via the Command Line Interface.


# CONSENSUS BREAKING CHANGE 

## What does it mean to break consensus
A consensus-breaking change is a modification to the fundamental rules that govern how nodes in a blockchain network validate transactions and reach agreement on the state of the ledger. This type of change can create a division in the network, as nodes may no longer agree on the valid state of the blockchain.

Such a situation often results in a "hard fork," where the network splits into two separate chains that operate under incompatible rules. These separate chains each have its own version of the blockchain history

## Why my change would break consensus 
The change I implemented modifies the structure of the stored contact record by introducing a new field: nickname. This affects both transaction validation and state compatibility, leading to a consensus-breaking scenario.

1. Transaction Validation Changes

The create-contact transaction now requires an additional nickname parameter.
Old nodes do not expect this field and will reject transactions that include it.
This creates inconsistent behavior across the networkâ€”new nodes accept the updated transaction format, while old nodes reject it, leading to a potential fork.

2. State Compatibility Issues

Contact entries stored on the blockchain now include the nickname field.
When an old node attempts to process a block containing a contact with this new field, it fails to decode the data because its expected data structure is different.
This results in a state mismatch, where different nodes interpret the blockchain state inconsistently, further splitting the network.

The below commands are updated to accomodate the consensus breaking change.

## Get started

ignite chain build

build command builds the blockchain

ignite chain serve

serve command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

addressbookd keys add [wallet name]

command creates wallet to interact with the blockchain (if needed)



## Creating a Contact 

addressbookd tx addressbook create-contact [first-name] [last-name] [phone] [email] [address] [nickname] [flags]

example usage: 

addressbookd tx addressbook create-contact Hrishikesh Sathyian 87175643 hrishi@gmail.com Yishun BigDawg --from Alice --chain-id addressbook



## Updating a Contact 

addressbookd tx addressbook update-contact [first-name] [last-name] [phone] [email] [address] [nickname] [0] [flags]

example usage: 

addressbookd tx addressbook create-contact Hrishikesh Sathyian 87175643 hrishi@gmail.com Yishun SmallDawg 0 --from Alice --chain-id addressbook


## Deleting a Contact 

addressbookd tx addressbook delete-contact [id]

example usage: 

addressbookd tx addressbook delete-contact 0 --from Alice --chain-id addressbook



## Querying Contacts 

addressbookd q addressbook list-contact 

list-contact displays all contacts in the blockchain

 addressbookd q addressbook show-contact [id]

show-contact queries the contact with the specified id number
